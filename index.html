        <h3>Software Consultant</h3>
        <p>I got into computing while studying Astrophysics at University. In my career I have been a developer, support engineer,
          Professional Services consultant and technical account manager, with experience working on defence projects to working with mobile
        telecomms companies. I have learnt Java, JavaScript and Python. Recently I have started learning web development.</p>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>I started to learn the piano at around age of 7, getting to Grade 8 of the ABRSM (UK).  I also learnt the accordion. I have played in a few bands, on keyboard,
          and folk music groups on the accordion. In more recent years I have taken up the guitar (acoustic) and mandolin.  would also love to learn the violin, one day.
          My big wish is to start composing my own music.</p>
